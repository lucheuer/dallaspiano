          <h1>Pitch Raising</h1>


          <p>If a piano has not been tuned regularly it will likely require a pitch raise before tuning
          to achieve good tuning stability. Your piano will sound best when it is tuned to A-440 (the A above
          middle C vibrates at 440 cycles per second.
          Many young students of piano will have a hard time developing good pitch memory if the the piano that they
          practice on is not kept at the correct pitch. The pitch raise is like a rough draft of the tuning.
          It is done by over-pulling the strings slightly above pitch so that they will settle down on the target ptich.
          After the pitch raise is done then the tuner can perform a normal fine tuning and achieve stability in the
          tension of the strings.</p>

        <h1>Piano Action Regulation</h1>

        <p>You have probably experienced playing different pianos and noticed that some pianos seem more responsive to your
           touch than others and allow you to play with much more precision and ease. These pianos are probably in very good
           regulation. Regulation is the adjustment of the mechanical aspects of your piano to re-balance it after dimensional
           changes from compacting felt, cloth and wood and changes in wood and wool parts of the action due to humidity
           fluctuations.All upright and grand pianos will need some regulation periodically to perform their best. Regulation
           is all about optimizing the key stroke made by your fingers and transferring that energy smoothly into the hammers,
           strings and ultimately the music coming from your piano.</p>

        <h1>Piano Finish Care</h1>

        <p>Unlike some musical instruments that you can put away in the closest after practicing, the piano remains a prominent
           feature of the room and is both musical instrument and fine furniture. This makes the piano's finish very important
           for the decor of the room. Maintaining the quality of your piano's finish will enhance your aesthetic enjoyment and o
           the instrument and also preserve the value of your piano. Basic finish care should be understood by all piano owners.
           Pianos are finished in many different ways. Some are traditional lacquer and others more modern polyurethanes and
           polyester resins. The finish is not only designed to enhance the beauty of the wood but also to protect it from humidity
           fluctuations and other damage.Most piano finishes are designed to protect the wood without the aid of polishes or
           waxes. It is best simply to keep the piano clean and avoid exposing it to direct sunlight and extremes of temperature
           and humidity. When dusting be careful not the scratch the piano. Dust can be abrasive and leave small scratch marks.
           Use a feather duster or soft cotton cloth. You can also clean the piano with a slightly damp clothe but if doing so
           please follow with soft dry cotton one to avoid leaving too much moisture behind. Do not over-wet your cleaning cloth.
           To remove fingerprints and smudges first try using the damp/dry cloths suggested above. If that doesn't work it is fine to use a
           mild soap like Murphy's oil soap on a soft cotton cloth. Place your piano in a room away from direct sunlight, fireplaces
           or heaters and other vents. It is a good idea to have the piano away from an outside facing wall as well to avoid exposing it as
           much as you can from humidity changes.</p>
